## Meeting Report: Project Technology Stack & Requirements Discussion

**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Attendees:** Eno-obong Etim Bassey, Pablo Daniel Zabaleta, Maria Arevalo Narvaez, Ebenezer Edem John

### Meeting Overview
The team convened to establish the technical foundation and core requirements for the CSE-325 Dotnet Project. After evaluating the seven proposed application ideas, the team reached consensus on the technology stack and key architectural components to be implemented across the selected project.

### Technology Stack Decision
The team collectively decided to utilize the following technologies:
- **Framework:** ASP.NET (Microsoft's web application framework)
- **Platform:** .NET (latest version for robust and scalable development)
- **Programming Language:** C# (strongly-typed, object-oriented language with excellent IDE support)

### Core Architectural Requirements
The team identified and committed to implementing the following essential features and layers in the application:

1. **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for data management
2. **Validation** - Input validation and business logic validation to ensure data integrity
3. **Authentication** - User identity verification system to control access to the application
4. **Middleware** - Custom middleware components for request/response processing and cross-cutting concerns
5. **Authorization** - Role-based and permission-based access control to secure application resources

### Rationale
The team selected this technology stack for its:
- Strong ecosystem and community support
- Excellent scalability and performance
- Built-in security features and industry best practices
- Comprehensive tooling and frameworks for rapid development
- Suitability for implementing enterprise-level applications

### Next Steps
1. Select the final application proposal from the list of seven ideas
2. Begin architectural design and database schema planning
3. Set up development environment and project repository
4. Establish coding standards and development workflow
